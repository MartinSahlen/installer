# Installer is a WIP

It is thought to be a website where you can search for, download, share and store lists of
your Mac applications. So when you format / get a new Mac, all your dear apps and tools (both CLI and GUI)
can be reinstalled with a simple command.

For instance apps such as mysql, docker, redis, Spotify Chrome.
